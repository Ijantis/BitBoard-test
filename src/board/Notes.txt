Next thing to do

Need to check if Kings move into attacked squares.
Also to be added is if piece is moved and same king in check then move not allowed.

TODO:
Castling
En passant
state checking (draw,checkmate) - partially implemented.

For en passant when a pawn moves two squares set a variable for each square. Bitboard of en passant squares?

For castling if its possible getKingMoves() | getCastleSquares()

Pulling out the leftmost bit instead of creating a string and looping to add 0s to it.
