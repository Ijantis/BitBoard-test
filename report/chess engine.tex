\chapter{Introduction and Abstract}


I have elected to create a mobile powered chess application. This background research report will outline the methods I have chosen for my application. The project as a whole is consisted of four main components. \newline

The core component and the backbone of the entire project is the game logic with which other . This component contains classes and methods for things such as the position of the pieces, calculations on valid and legal moves, and deciding when the game has come to a conclusion by either a player winning or a draw.
