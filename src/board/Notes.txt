Next thing to do

Need to check if Kings move into attacked squares.
Also to be added is if piece is moved and same king in check then move not allowed.

TODO:
Castling
En passant
state checking (draw,checkmate)


-Added king moves
-Added vertical pawn moves single and double rank
-Added diagonal pawn moves
-Added knight moves
-Added move generation for rooks
-Added move generation for bishops
-Added move generation for queens
-Added method to check if a king is in check
-Added squares under attack.
-Added move generation
-Added a check to disallow moves which put self king in check

CHECK IF GET BISHOP MOVES SUPPORTS MORE THAN ONE BISHOP

To check if a king is in check : if ((KingOccupiedSquare & squaresUnderAttack) != 0) if it doesnt equal zero then king is in check. 
If it equals 0 then king is not in check

For en passant when a pawn moves two squares set a variable for each square. Bitboard of en passant squares?

For castling if its possible getKingMoves() | getCastleSquares()
