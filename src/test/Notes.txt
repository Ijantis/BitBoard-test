Next thing to do

Need to check if Kings move into attacked squares.
Also to be added is if piece is moved and same king in check then move not allowed.

Generate Black king possible moves
Generate Knight possible moves
Generate Pawn possible moves

-Added black king moves
-Added vertical pawn moves single and double rank


To check if a king is in check : if ((KingOccupiedSquare & squaresUnderAttack) != 0) if it doesnt equal zero then king is in check. 
If it equals 0 then king is not in check
