Next thing to do

Need to check if Kings move into attacked squares.
Also to be added is if piece is moved and same king in check then move not allowed.

TODO:

EVALUATION:

pawns are worth 100 points
bishops 300
rooks 500
knights 300
queens 900

-20 per doubled pawn
isolated pawns -20

hanging pieces:
pawn
rook
knight
bishop
queen

protected pieces:
pawn
rook
knight 
bishop
queen

for evaluation function add a check for unprotected pieces and make it negative.

Pulling out the leftmost bit instead of creating a string and looping to add 0s to it.

Using char array instead of String array gave me a small speedup from 13000ms to 11500ms from inital position to four moves in.

perft/divide test
starting position giving me this:
