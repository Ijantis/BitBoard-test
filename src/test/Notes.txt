To check if a king is in check : if ((KingOccupiedSquare & squaresUnderAttack) != 0) if it doesnt equal zero then king is in check. 
If it equals 0 then king is not in check

For en passant when a pawn moves two squares set a variable for each square. Bitboard of en passant squares?

For castling if its possible getKingMoves() | getCastleSquares()
