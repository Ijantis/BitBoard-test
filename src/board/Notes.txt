Next thing to do

Need to check if Kings move into attacked squares.
Also to be added is if piece is moved and same king in check then move not allowed.

TODO:
Generate Black king possible moves.
Generate Pawn possible moves.
Generate Knight possible moves.
Generate moves for single rook.
Generate moves for multiple rooks.
Generate moves for bishop.
Generate moves for queen.

-Added king moves
-Added vertical pawn moves single and double rank
-Added diagonal pawn moves
-Added knight moves
-Added move generation for rooks
-Added move generation for bishops
-Added move generation for queens
-Added method to check if a king is in check
-Added squares under attack.

Diagonal pawn moves only show up when enemy piece is present in the diagonal. If you want to generate a list of
squares under attack you need a seperate method for ignoring the condition.
The same thing happens for every other piece. A white knight with a white piece in one of its attacked squares
won't show up when the getWhiteAttackedSquares method is called even though the square is under attack.
Seperate method for every single class?
Does an occupied square count as being under attack if the attacking piece is the same colour?????

CHECK IF GET BISHOP MOVES SUPPORTS MORE THAN ONE BISHOP


To check if a king is in check : if ((KingOccupiedSquare & squaresUnderAttack) != 0) if it doesnt equal zero then king is in check. 
If it equals 0 then king is not in check

For en passant when a pawn moves two squares set a variable for each square. Bitboard of en passant squares?

For castling if its possible getKingMoves() | getCastleSquares()
